Utilizing HTML/CSS and JS to create a dynamic webpage. JavaScript (JS) creates the codes for the tables while HTML/CSS creates the styling.

## Results
To perform a search the textbox can be used to sort through data. Dates, cities, states, countries, and shapes can be sorted though. However in this case searches have to be exact or no results can be returned.

## Summary
As mentioned one of the major drawbacks of this table is having to be precise in searches. I would recommend (if possible) making responses non-case sensitive or producing a "did you mean" response routing the enduser to the correct page in cases of spelling errors. I think another response could be utilization of drop down menus or sorting within the headers. As of current there are multiple results, but if this database were to expand I think a drop down menu of availables dates and states in the header or filter could cut time in having to search for items. I could make it easier for the user to determine if this application even has the information they are looking for within havinf to search via text.
